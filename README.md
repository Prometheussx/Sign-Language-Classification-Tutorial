# Sign Language Classification
üèÜ Accuracy: %93.54

## Overview

This project focuses on classifying sign language images representing the numbers 0 and 1. The model achieves an impressive accuracy rate of 93.54%. This project has applications in sign language recognition and communication.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains images of hand signs for the numbers 0 and 1 in sign language. It includes two categories, one for each number.
Data Link: [Kaggle Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ardamavi/sign-language-digits-dataset)**
## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following sections:

1. **Library and Input Files:** In this section, we import the necessary Python libraries and load the dataset.

2. **Data Loading and Visualization:** We load the sign language dataset and provide visualizations of the data.

3. **Data Preprocessing:** The dataset is preprocessed and organized for model training.

4. **Train-Test Split:** We split the data into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

5. **Flatten Operation:** Images are flattened to prepare them for training.

6. **Transpose Operation:** Data is transposed to match the required dimensions.

7. **Initialize Weights and Bias:** We initialize the weights and bias for logistic regression.

8. **Sigmoid Function:** The sigmoid function is defined, which is a crucial part of logistic regression.

9. **Forward-Backward Propagation:** Forward and backward propagation steps are explained for logistic regression.

10. **Updating Parameters:** The model parameters, including weights and bias, are updated using the gradient descent algorithm.

11. **Prediction:** We make predictions using the trained model.

12. **Logistic Regression Algorithm:** The logistic regression algorithm is executed, and results are displayed.
